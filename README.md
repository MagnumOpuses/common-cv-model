# Common Data Structure

This repository contains information about the common data structure that [AF-Connect](https://github.com/MagnumOpuses/af-connect) will be providing as a response.
It is the common structure provided by the HROpen standard (https://hropenstandards.org/).

There is a plan for adding (or finding and repurposing existing sections of the structure) that will be describing the Gig market.

It is understood that this structure is quite extensive and rich and includes a lot of sections that might seem irrelevant at the moment. They have been kept both because the organization feels that it should provide a solution that can cover all the needs of the labour market. The part of the structure that is used in the [AF-Connect project](https://github.com/MagnumOpuses/af-connect) is CandidateType and the substructures it requires. 

Examples for each part of the structure can be found along side the definitions in their designated folder.

This project also adds an [envelope](https://github.com/MagnumOpuses/common-cv-model/tree/master/envelope) to the structure that is used to wrape and transfer the data for the purposes of [AF-Connect](https://github.com/MagnumOpuses/af-connect). In the same folder as the definition an axample of the full response from [AF-Connect project](https://github.com/MagnumOpuses/af-connect) can be [found](https://github.com/MagnumOpuses/common-cv-model/blob/master/envelope/example_WithHROpen421.json).

This is but the first version of this common structure and we are looking forward to input from users and collaborators, through pull requests.
